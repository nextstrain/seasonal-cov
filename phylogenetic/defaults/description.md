We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting
laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their
work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared
data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free

possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances.
Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if
uncertain.

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as the starting point
for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat
files at:
